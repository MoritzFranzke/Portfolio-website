        <h2 class="top-padding-needed">The Project</h2>
          Shopping furniture can be hard. Everyone who once moved into a new place and was searching for the perfect couch and that premium looking dinner table that they saw on Pinterest once knows that. But the truth is, if you don’t love the ever so bland looking ikea style, you are in for a long ride until you find furniture that you love.
          Sequo is about to change that. It is an online shop that is all about recommendation - without ever being too intrusive. Subtle recommendations are found on nearly every screen and turn the customer user’s buying journey into a delightful - and most importantly successful - experience.
          </p>

      <div>
        <h2 class="top-padding-needed">User Stories</h2>
          <p>
            A good product solves actual problems users have. That is why user stories are so important. They represent the users interest and make sure that their needs are met.
          </p>
          <h3>Story #1</h3>
          <p>
            „As a new customer, I want to access the inventory without having to register, so that I canmake sure this store has what I’m looking for before having to create an account.“
          </p>
          <h3>Story #2</h3>
          <p>
            „As a customer, I want to have access to advanced filtering options, so that I don’t have to browse through a lot of products to find what I’m looking for.“
          </p>
          <h3>Story #3</h3>
          <p>
            „As a frequent customer, I want to see recommendations of products I may like, so that I find items I might not otherwise on my own.“

          <h2 class="top-padding-needed">User Flow Diagram</h2>
          <p>
            Based on the previously determined user goals, the user flow diagram depicts the structural blueprint for the product-to-be.

          <h2 class="top-padding-needed">Low Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
          <p>
            To acquire a first idea of how the layout should be organized, low-fidelity wireframes have been made.
            Out of these user goals, user flows and the related low-fidelity wireframes could be created. Since we chose a mobile-first approach, we focused on the layout for the corresponding breakpoint.
          </p>

          <h2 class="top-padding-needed">Putting it into diagrams</h2>
          <p>
            These user-flows where then combined to form the user-flow diagram which gives an oversight over the whole page and how users would navigate through it.
          </p>

          <h2 class="top-padding-needed">Mid-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
          <p>
            The first ideas which were captured in low fidelity wireframes were then translated into mid fidelity ones using adobe XD. They include proper spacing as well as realistic placeholders (in terms of size) for the content that would later be applied.
          </p>
          <div>
          <picture>
            <source srcset="img/sequo/sequo-@1/sequo-mid-fidelity-wireframes-@1.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">

        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 class="top-padding-needed">User Testing</h2>
          <p>
            Before those wireframes could be iteratively improved until they would reach the final product, we would have to have the illustrative elements already finalized to be able to work with them in the design.
            <br>
            To make sure the product would be intuitive and self-explanatory before turning it into the final design, a user testing has been conducted. The users were given a task which was to be completed within a prototype made out of the mid fidelity wireframes:
            <br>
            Order a product without signing up.
            <br>
            Additionally, they were given instructions to make them pay special attention on the interface during the testing.
            <br>
            Think about how intuitive the interface is. Where would you click to accomplish your goal?
            <br>
            At the end you will be asked what you think could be improved.
            <br>
            Unfortunately, none of the participants had any suggestions on what could be improved, as they simply liked the product as it is.
            Even fellow design students had no pain points that could be fixed.
            Even though I was sure that the product was not yet perfect, it was relatively safe to say that there wouldn’t be any major design issues which had to be optimized and I could progress with the next set of wireframes.

          <h2 class="top-padding-needed">Final Wireframes</h2>
          <p>
            Afterwards, the final styling for all elements as well as imagery has been applied.

          <h2 class="top-padding-needed">Desktop Adaptation</h2>
          <p>
          Although the design has been created following the mobile-first approach, it would also live on desktop screens as well. Thats why the desktop designs have been designed afterwards, adhering closely to their mobile counterparts.
