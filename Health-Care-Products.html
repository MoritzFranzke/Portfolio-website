        <h2 class="top-padding-needed">The Challenge</h2>
          <p>This was my most extensive project so far. The reason for that lies in the different problems that have been evaluated. In an analysis of the status quo of the company, several problem areas could be determined. The first one was the high bounce rate of visitors of the website. While all online ads performed well, visitors were consistently leaving the site within a few seconds.
            The second one was the insufficient branding. With the rising competition in the field, consistent branding and the binding of consumers to the brand becomes more important by the day.
            <br>
            The reason for the first problem could be determined quite fast. Website data from Google analytics in conjunction with the data from the ads revealed, that mobile users were much more likely to leave the website without any action than desktop or tablet users. A deeper look into the mobile version showed, that the website was primarily built for desktop usage. However, most users search for relevant keywords and therefore visit the site using their phone.
            <br>
            The second one was more complex. While the branding was obviously outdated, a complete overhaul is often very expensive and requires very good planning since all products and packages need to be redesigned, while re-orientating all other communication channels.
            Since budget was a highly influential factor when it came to the decision on how to execute the rebranding, it was decided to do a “soft-rebrand”. This was the logical step, since the brand never positioned itself clearly and had no active efforts to create a unique, consistent brand, which made it a more or less blank canvas. That’s why the visual redesign of the website as an inevitable necessity should propose the first step to a more refined and intentional branding.
            <br>
            During this project, I was responsible for designing the UI and coordinating the implementation. Additionally, together with my colleague Lisa Feilen, I led the branding process as well carried out the whole UX process, including surveys, user flows, and Jobs to be done. In the following case study, some parts were led out or summarized in order to keep it sleek.

        <div>
          <h2 class="top-padding-needed">Getting Started</h2>
          <p>
            First things first, the branding. With the help of a questionnaire, and several meetings, the founders and managers of the company were asked to put their ideas of the company into words. A vision of what the brand should be and the values it stands for as well as a mission were put into words, which were then refined until the gist of the brand could be put into a few sentences. This basis for the branding is not only important to keep the whole company on course, but also to make sure the website and all other communication channels would be consistent with one another and would represent the brand genuinely.
            <br>
            After the basis was build, a matching visual representation had to be found so that the new website would depict the brand’s essence adequately. It should be one that would not stray too far from the product-designs since they would keep their look – at least for now. At the same time, the new website should represent the emotional aspect of the company, since the products themselves are pretty soberly looking.
            <br>
            With that step began the first hurdle. It turned out to be really difficult to find the right art style. After all, it would be the basis for the whole website as well as the main emotional influence on the visitors. At first, it was not clear whether we’d go with photographs or some kind of illustration. After an ideation phase, in which we built moodboards, discussed what would fit the brand image we had best, and some trial and error, we settled on the idea of hand-drawn illustrations. To find an illustrator turned out to be a real challenge. Especially one who’s art style would not only match the company’s values and the related design language, but at the same time wouldn’t blow the budget.

          <h2 class="top-padding-needed">Defining the users</h2>
          <p>
            Parallel to the whole phase of ideation for the face of the brand, the first UX processes were conducted with the first one being the definition of user categories and their related user goals. In this process, we identified three types of users:
          </p>
          <h3>The Uninformed</h3>
          <p>
            Uninformed users usually come via ads since they neither know about the company and their products, nor do they know about the main ingredients – propolis and manuka honey. Because of their visiting the website, they are probably to some degree interested in organic cosmetics and/or healthcare products. Their goal is to have a look at what the company is doing and what the products propose.
          </p>
          <h3>The Informed</h3>
          <p>
            Users who belong to this group already have an idea what propolis and manuka honey are and are likely gathering information about the products to evaluate if they are worth to switch to them. These users have a high probability of being in the market for such products and could become customers. All they need are good reasons to try the products out.
          </p>
          <h3>Customers</h3>
          <p>
            This group is the obvious one. It accounts for all people who at some point used our products and are familiar with them as well as their ingredients.
            Their goals consist mainly of practical errands. This includes the research on where to buy the products, as well as gathering information about other products or about products they bought. Finally, they may want to get in touch if they had additional questions or reclamations.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 class="top-padding-needed">Answering important questions</h2>
          <p>
            The analysis of the different main user groups enabled us to determine which information should be communicated, and how to do so. The most important questions that should be answered on the homepage would be:
            <ul>
              <li> Who are we and what do we do?</li>
              <li> What makes the products so special?</li>
              <li>What kinds of products are for sale?</li>
              <li> What are the special ingredients and why do we believe in them?</li>
              <li> Where can I get the products?</li>
              <br>
            </ul>
            Out of these user goals, user flows and the related low-fidelity wireframes could be created. Since we chose a mobile-first approach, we focused on the layout for the corresponding breakpoint.

        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 class="top-padding-needed">Putting it into diagrams</h2>
          <p>
            These user-flows where then combined to form the user-flow diagram which gives an oversight over the whole page and how users would navigate through it.

        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 class="top-padding-needed">Mid-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
          <p>
            After the typefaces and typographical hierarchy had been defined, the low-fidelity wireframes were translated into mid-fidelity ones on which I then could iteratively improve upon.
          </p>
          <div>
          <picture>
            <source srcset="img/hcp/hcp-@1/hcp-mid-fidelity-wireframes-@1.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">

          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 class="top-padding-needed">Finally finding someone</h2>
          <p>
            Before those wireframes could be iteratively improved until they would reach the final product, we would have to have the illustrative elements already finalized to be able to work with them in the design.
            <br>
            After a fair amount of searching, we finally found an illustrator who was within our budget and who’s style matchet the brand values we had defined perfectly.
            During the first ideation phase, we had already determined the use cases of the illustrations so we could instantaneously begin with the first illustration, which would show whether the illustrator would be able to catch the brands spirit. Fortunately, she did, and greatly so. The first illustration was a small one, so that we could make sure we would work good together before we would commission the larger ones and risking more money and time. After the first illustration – our brand bee – had been finished, we went ahead with our most important illustration, the header.
            While we were waiting for our illustrator to finish up the header, I contacted our developer and asked him for a rough estimate how long it would take us until the site would go live and what it would cost us. We also discussed some elements and how they could be implemented so that it would be taken into consideration before I’d design the final set of wireframes.
            <br>
            After we knew exactly how the illustrations would look like, I was able to choose matching colors, apply the styling to each element, and finish up the wireframes, using placeholders where the remaining illustrations would be. I then handed the wireframes and every important asset off to the developer. This enabled him to start with the development process and coordinate with me whenever he ran into unexpected technical limitations or questions regarding the layout.
            <br>
            The website is currently in development and is expected to go live within the next few weeks.
