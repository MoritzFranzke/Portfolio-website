        <h2 class="top-padding-needed">The Project</h2>
        <p>
          Letterline was a personal project which served as an exploration of designing native apps for both iOS and Android.
          <br>
          Although the scope of the project was mainly to design a native app that aligns with the guidelines for the respective mobile OS, I wanted the app to feel like an actual product. That required the app to have USPs which are needed to differentiate it from existing apps within the same service area and solving actual problems users have.
          <br>
          Having settled for a digital magazine reader/news app, I analyzed the existing services the market offers and found a niche that has not been filled as of today. Although there are services that let subscriber access a vast range of various magazines, they do little more than providing mere digital versions of said magazines. On the other side are apps like medium, who’s value proposition lies basically in the algorithm that recommends the users articles within their interests. Such services are flawed in the way of how they provide articles. Virtually everybody can publish articles on medium, which naturally drags down the average quality of the articles.
          <br>
          Here comes Letterline into play. Technically, it combines the two ideas and is thus able to utilize the strengths of algorithmic recommendations while still providing articles and news of great quality, since they stem from actual publications.

        <h2 class="top-padding-needed">User Flow Diagram</h2>
          <p>
            After researching competitors’ apps, I created the user flows.
            <br>
            The user flow diagram gives an overview of the necessary screens and structure of the app. Over the course of the project some more screens were added although the basic structure did not change.

          <h2 class="top-padding-needed">Sketches</h2>
          <p>
            To build upon this structural blueprint, I’ve decided to determine the content of each screen and sketch them out. This ensured that no feature that was previously planned would be missing in the final product and also served as an orientational guideline for the first set of mid-fidelity wireframes.

          <h2 class="top-padding-needed">Mid-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
          <p>
            These sketches were then translated into mid-fidelity wireframes for both Android as well as iOS.
            As far as design patterns and layout are concerned, I’ve chosen to not go for some highly experimental and unusual options, but rather sticking to the well-known. This was to let the user focus fully on the content provided. Also, reading is a highly ritualistic activity. People often read certain types of content on certain times of the day. To help them switch to Letterline from their previously used application more easily, they should feel like they know their way around the app without much onboarding. Thats why I made sure to stick to the design guidelines of the respective OS as close as possible.

          <p>
            Giving the product a character
            <br>
            The focus on the content was a somewhat recurring theme throughout the whole design process. Naturally it also found its way into the styling of the individual elements. That’s why the colors are rather light, without drawing too much attention, while still adding some friendliness to the design language. The typefaces in use have been chosen according to the OS. While the iOS version utilizes the system font SF Pro, the android version displays text in Google’s very own Roboto. The only exception is the H1 and H2 as well as the “Large” text size. For those I opted for Recoleta, a friendly and heartly typeface that conveys a certain warmth without feeling too goofy or childish. The retro flair it emits reminisces of the golden times of printed publications and reflects the high quality of articles that Letterline offers.
            <br>
            The elements adhere to the respective guidelines. As far as iconography is concerned, I used the predesigned icons Material and Apple provide wherever possible. If an icon was missing, I designed it myself, while sticking to the general style of the available icons.

            I kept evolving the wireframes into a proper product, adding the final styling to each element as well as inserting actual copy and imagery.

          <h2 class="top-padding-needed">User Testing & Feedback</h2>
          <p>
            With the screens being polished to a high-fidelity level and all the elements set in place, it was time for a user testing to ensure all of the design patterns would be easily understood by a typical user.
            <br>
            Although I constantly sought feedback while designing the interface, it was vital at this point to gather feedback from people who were fully uninvolved to make improvements before finalizing the project.
          </p>
          <h3 class="top-padding-needed">The Feedback</h3>
          <p>
            <h4>Ryan</h4>
            “News” and “Home” seem like very similar areas of the app. How can you differentiate them?
            <br>
            The Nav icons could be simplified. For example the roof of the house in Home and the frame of the magnifying glass in Search could be reduced to one solid shape, not and outline. Particularly when you select Search, the blue coloured in lines don’t look good at that size. I would just have solid icons, grey when inactive, and blue when active.“

            <h4>Amanda</h4>
            „The icons appear outlined (double stroked) and don’t feel as clean as they could be if they were simplified into single strokes.“

            <h4>Lisa</h4>
            „Saved Articles - Would also color it blue to show that I already saved it
            <br>
            Edit Interests - Color chosen tags blue? I think it could be easier then to keep them apart from the recommended tags.“

            <h4>Samuel</h4>
            “On the ions.. when zooming in, I can see artistically you are going for a coloured in line drawing style, almost like a children’s picture book style. However from afar, it looks more like a graphics glitch, and reduces the professional vibe of the app. Particularly when the icons are the only elements in the app that adopt this look, (the rest is super clean and pro) the icons just look cheap and out of place. Either consider continuing this style throughout all the UI in the app, or change the icons to something more traditional.“
          </p>
          <h3 class="top-padding-needed">Changes made due to the feedback</h3>
          <p>
            The most notable change I’ve made was the visual revision of the icons in the tab bar. Every element that previously had an off-set fill and was outlined has now been changed to a simple fill without the black outlines.
            <br>
            Screens that show the process of purchasing Letterline Premium have been added.
            <br>
            Additionally, some small quality of life improvements have been made such as the coloring of small elements to encourage interaction and focus the user’s attention as well as communicating a change of states more clearly.
            <br>
            Last but not least, the menu item „News“ has been renamed to „Daily News“ to match it’s purpose better as well as address the issue that some users had problems with distinguishing the news from the home feed, functionality-wise.

          <p>
            After resolving the most important issues that users pointed out, the project was finished up.

          <h2 class="top-padding-needed">Takeaways</h2>
          <p>
            Especially the feedback gathered in the final round of user testing held some great insights for me. I’ve learned about the importance to fully commit to a chosen design language rather than trying too hard to give the app a personality it doesn’t need.
            <br>
            I really do believe the app could have success if it were to be developed and marketed properly. Something similar will inevitably arise some not so far day in the future, since the magazine market as of now is still not making proper use of the opportunities the digital world offers. The individual publications are too restrictive in their expectation of having a user committing and subscribing to a single publication for a monthly fee. Users nowadays are used to paying a monthly fee each month in exchange for a seemingly unlimited supply of content. The magazine market simply lacks the necessary flexibility.
